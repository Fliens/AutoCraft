## How to use the plugin:

You want to automate everything?

This plugin takes care of the crafting.

Simply put an item frame (or glow item frame) with a crafting table in it on a dispenser. Put the recipe of the item
you'd like to get crafted in the dispenser.

This automatic crafting table will now take needed items out of the inventory behind it and put the crafted item in the
inventory in front of it. Time between actions can be configured (*default is 8 ticks - hopper speed*).

Works with shaped and shapeless recipes **from the recipe book** (as well as with some extra recipes like firework rockets) and with every block that has an inventory.

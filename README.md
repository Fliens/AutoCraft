This plugin takes crafting of your shoulders.

Simply put an itemframe with a craftingtable in it on a dispenser. And put the recipe of the item you'd like to get craftet in the dispenser.

This automatic craftingtable will now take every second(20 ticks) the needed items out of the inventory behind it and put the crafted item in the inventory infront of it.

Works with shaped and shapeless recipes and with every block that has an inventory.
